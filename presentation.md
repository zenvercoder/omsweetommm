### How I made this app in 6 days

* Found cool stuff on the internet. Put it all together in one package.


##Day 1


* Searched "Ripple" on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/), found [Ripple CodePen](http://codepen.io/daless14/pen/ELFgj) by [Anthony DAlessio](http://codepen.io/daless14/)

* [Using the Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Using_Web_Audio_API#Creating_an_audio_context)

*  [Voice-change-O-matic](https://mdn.github.io/voice-change-o-matic/)

* [Lotus Flower](http://codepen.io/mrfarmer777/pen/RaEeBb) by [Matt Farmer](http://codepen.io/mrfarmer777/)

* Searched for "Sand" on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/), found [Landscape Circle SVG](http://codepen.io/timrijkse/pen/XNjQBR) by [Tim Rijkse](http://codepen.io/timrijkse/)

## Day 2

* Did some styling. Moved some stuff around.

* Playing with this  [Landscape Circle SVG](http://codepen.io/timrijkse/pen/XNjQBR) thing. Trying to get the bouncy circle to work. Having difficulty.

## Day 3

* Still playing with this [Landscape Circle SVG](http://codepen.io/timrijkse/pen/XNjQBR) pen. When I cut out the tress and mountains, the circle just sits there statically. Researching `TimelineMax` brought me to [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/). This is an interesting site. I look forward to playing with this.

## Other Cool Pens

* also found http://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/zxgzMQ and http://codepen.io/chrisgannon/pen/ZWRgza

* Needed a button, found [Button Hover States](http://codepen.io/thejamespower/pen/OVNYLL) by [James Power](http://codepen.io/thejamespower/) on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/)

* [Rainbow Galaxy](http://codepen.io/towc/pen/eNEBQX) by [Matei Copot](http://codepen.io/towc/)
